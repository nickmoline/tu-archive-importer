tu-archive-importer
===================

A wonderfully simple tool to import your Twitter archive into ThinkUp.

Instructions
------------
1. **This is very much beta. Make a backup before you run this.**
2. Put your tweet JS files in 'tweets'... it should look like this: http://d.pr/i/pkoP
3. Copy config.sample.php to config.php and update with your actual db configuration
4. Run it from the CLI.

HUGE thanks to [@henriwatson](https://github.com/henriwatson) for writing the tweet parsing code. I procrastinated on it and then he was awesome and did it for me.
